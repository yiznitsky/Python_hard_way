#Exercise 11 Notes
Asking questions

#Most of what software does is the following:
```bash
1. Take some kind of input from a person.
2. Change it.
3. Print out something to show how it changed.
```

#NOTE
>We put a `,`(comma) at the end of `print` line.
>This is so `Print` doesn't end the line with a newline.
>character and go to the next line.

#Raw_input():
>If the `prompt` argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline.
>The function then reads a line from **input**, converts it t a **string** (stripping a trailing newline),
>and returns that.
